Plans for restructuring memojs into React

Make a component out of Card.
    The return/render function of this will be based on
    the .card class HTML div element used in memojs.
    Q: function or class?

Make components out of the child elements in Card
    Each component can either incorporate its own event handling
    functions, or they can be gathered in Card

    Q: functions, not classes?

    Q: make a component containing all aspects common to cardButtons,
        akin to the .cardButton CSS class from memojs?
        We could pass icons and handlers as props to this,
        and use it for all 3 (and future) buttons on Card.



original App.js return JSX:
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="https://reactjs.org"
          target="_blank"
